# Build

Build in thin vertical slices. Implement one piece, verify it, commit it, then move on. Never accumulate uncommitted work across multiple files.

## Workflow

1. **Pick the smallest slice** that delivers a complete, testable path through the change.
2. **Read before writing.** Load the relevant files, understand existing patterns, check for utilities you can reuse.
3. **Implement the slice.** Stay within its boundary — don't fix adjacent issues or refactor unrelated code.
4. **Verify the slice.** Run the targeted tests, then the project's full verification. The build must pass after every slice.
5. **Commit the slice.** One logical change per commit.
6. **Repeat.** Pick the next slice. If the plan needs adjusting, adjust it before continuing.

## Slicing strategies

- **Vertical slice** — one complete path through the stack (type + implementation + test). Preferred default.
- **Contract-first** — define the schema and types first, then implement consumers.
- **Risk-first** — tackle the uncertain part first, then build the straightforward parts on top.

## Red flags

- More than 3 files changed without a commit
- Tests haven't run since the last significant change
- Mixing refactoring with feature work in the same slice
- Expanding scope mid-slice instead of deferring to the next one
- "I'll commit it all at the end"
